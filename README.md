Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software using systematic methods. 
It is important in technology because it ensures reliable, efficient and user friendly applications for businesses and daily life.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
NATO Conference- established software engineering as a formal discipline.
Structured Programming- Reduces complexity and improves code reusability.
Agile development- Emphasizes flexibility, collaboration and iterative development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
(i)Planning- Defines project goals, scope and feasibility.
(ii)Requirement Analysis- Create system architecture and design specifications.
(iii)Design- Create system architecture and design specifications.
(iv)Implementation- Write and develop the actual software.
(v)Testing- Identify and fix bugs to ensure functionality.
(vi)Deployment- Release the software for users.
(vii)Maintenance- Update and improve the software as needed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WATERFALL AND AGILE METHODOLOGIES
(I)  Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach while Agile is iterative and flexible.
(II)  Waterfall requires detailed upfront planning whereas Agile allows for continous planning throughout development.
(III) Waterfall is rigid making changes difficult whereas Agile is adaptive allowing for frequent modifications.
(IV)  In Waterfall testing happens after development is complete while agile testing is continous throughout process.
(V)   Waterfall has minimal client involvement until the final product while agile testing is continous throughout the process.
APPROPRIATE SCENARIOS
(I)  Waterfall is best for projects with fixed requirements and minimal expected changes such as Banking systems of large government projects.
(ii) Agile is ideal for projects with flexibility and repid development such as mobile apps or ecommerce websites.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
Develops and implements software solutions
Debugs and fixes code issues
Collaborates with other team members to ensure functionality.
Follows best coding practices and documentation standards.
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER
Designs and executes test plans and cases.
Identifies and reports bugs or issues.
Ensures software functionality performance and security.
PROJECT MANAGER
Defines project scope, goals and timeline
Manages team workflow and ensures deadlines are met
Communicates with stakeholders and ensures project alignment
Identifies and miitigates project risks

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs helps developers write, debug and test code efficiently by providing essential tools in one interface example include visual studio code, Pycharm, Eclipse.
Version control system allows developers to track changes, collaborate efficiently and revert to previous versions if needed. Examples include Git, Mercurial and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging and fixing bugs- Bugs can be hard to find and fix.Use of debugging tools like chrome devtools can help
Keeping up with new Technologis- The tech industry evolves rapidily making it difficult to keep up with them.They could take online courses or follow tech blogs in order to keep up.
Managing Tigh Deadlines- Projects often have strict time constraints.They could use project management tools like jilla or break tasks into smaller manageable tasks.
Team collaboration and communication-Miscommunication can cause project delays.They could use github or Microsoft Teams to collaborate or schedule regular meetings and stand ups.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing tests individuals components or functions of the software. It ensures that each unit of the code works properly catching a bug early in development.
Integration Testing tests how different components or modules work together. It identifies issues in data flow and interactions between integral parts.
System Testing tests the complete software system as a whole. It verifies that all components function together as expected in a real world environment.
Acceptance Testing ensures the software meets user requirement and business needs. It confirms that the final product is ready for release and meets customer expectations.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs to optimize responses from AI models. Its importance include:
Enhances AI ACCURACY- Well crafted prompts improve the relevance and precision o AI responses.
Increases Efficiency- Help users ger desired results quickly without multiple attempts.
Reduces Bias and Misinterpretation- clear prompts minimize misleading responses.
Customizes AI Behaviour- Enables tailoring responses for specitif tasks such as coding summarization or creative writing.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about cars
Improved Prompt: Explain the difference between electric and gasoline cars in terms of cost, environment impact and performance.
